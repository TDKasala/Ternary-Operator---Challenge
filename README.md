# Ternary Operator Challenge

This repository contains a simple C# console application that demonstrates the use of the ternary operator to determine weather conditions based on user input temperature.

## Overview

The program prompts the user to input a temperature and then determines the weather condition based on the temperature entered. It uses the ternary operator to evaluate conditions and produce a weather message accordingly.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.
- A C# compatible development environment such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any text editor of your choice.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TDKasala/Ternary-Operator-Challenge.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Ternary-Operator-Challenge
```

3. Compile and run the program:

```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter a temperature and observe the weather condition displayed.
